Many young women face challenges when it comes to understanding and managing menstruation. Traditional education methods often lack engagement, leaving them feeling unprepared and uncertain about their bodies. Existing period tracking apps may lack comprehensive educational resources and fail to address the holistic needs of users.


* ### Inspiration

Our inspiration stems from the realization that menstruation education and support for young women are crucial yet often overlooked aspects of reproductive health. We were motivated to create a platform that not only educates but also empowers young women to confidently manage their menstrual health and break societal taboos surrounding menstruation.

## What it does

Our platform, RED (Reproductive Education & Development), offers a comprehensive suite of resources and tools designed to educate, support, and empower young women about menstruation. It includes interactive games for learning, a period tracking feature, community support forums, and rewards for engagement.


Looking ahead, we plan to:

Continuously enhance and expand the platform's features and content to provide even greater educational value and support for our users.
Explore additional opportunities for gamification and interactive learning experiences to further engage and empower young women in their menstrual health education journey.
Collaborate with healthcare professionals, educators, and community organizations to ensure the platform remains relevant, informative, and inclusive for all users.
